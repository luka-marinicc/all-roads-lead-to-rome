> Every pixel, no matter where it begins, will eventually find its Rome.

A calm, diegetic systems-art simulation: citizens pursue a movable Rome with delayed awarenes, gradual adaptation, quiet arrival and rebirth

## Roadmap

- [ ] Rome at rest on load
- [ ] Delayed emergence of citizens
- [ ] Individual traits (motivation, awareness delay, inertia)
- [ ] Gradual reorientation when Rome moves
- [ ] Arrival → shrink into nothing → respawn
- [ ] Diegetic inscriptions (names, ETA) on hover
- [ ] (Later) Roads as memory: trails that younger citizens can follow

## Dev
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
